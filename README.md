# YouTube Speed Slider

Bookmarklet to adds a very basic slider element for controlling the playback
speed on YouTube.

The slider goes beyond the limit of 2 set by the YouTube UI. An arbitrary limit
of 10 is used to make the slider usable, but could technically go even higher.

Sound playback is disabled above 4. This is a limitation on YouTube's part.
